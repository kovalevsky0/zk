# Welcome to my Digital Garden!

This is the place where I share my knowledge with everyone on the Web and with myself.

Notes are drafts or pre-complete materials that I could use for writing articles on [my blog](/blog).

I take notes following [Zettelkasten method](../Zettelkasten%20method.md) and I use [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) app for this. Some notes might contain a format that is working in [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) well but could be not supported by my website (yet).

You can start navigating my [Digital Garden](../Digital%20Garden.md) here:
