# Subreddit 'byteski' Greeting post

Hello! Welcome to my subreddit. 

I am Max, a software developer based in ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º Europe.

Besides working as a developer I write a blog about programming in general, TypeScript, Node, vim/neovim, and other stuff. 

I also interested in writing and things like Second Brain, Zettelkasten, IndieWeb, etc.

Now I am in the process of re-design and re-writing my personal website. The first version of the website was written using Gatsby.js but I decided to rewrite it in Hugo static site generator.

As an announcement here is the screenshot of new version of the website. 

Stay in touch!
