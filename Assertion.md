# Assertion

It provides the ability to write code in test to check expected value and output value (the result of phase **Act** from [Arrange-Act-Assert](Arrange-Act-Assert.md)).

This functionality can be a part of the testing framework (example - [JestJS](JestJS.md)) or can be independent library like [Chai.js](Chai.js.md)
