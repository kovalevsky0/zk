# Behavior Driven Development

* The concept provides the ability to write test by kind of human language (natural language constructs). 
* It can be implemented by **frameworks**.
* Combines ideas from [Test Driven Development](Test%20Driven%20Development.md) and [Domain Driven Design](Domain%20Driven%20Design.md)

### Frameworks

* [Gherkin Syntax (cucumber.io)](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference)
