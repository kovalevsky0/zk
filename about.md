# About me

### Max Kovalevskii, a software developer

This is my website - the place where I share information and knowledge about topics that interest me with everyone and myself.

A software developer who wants to teach you everything about amazing technology such as Go (Golang) and more.

I write blog posts and make courses about topics that interest me most: [Go (Golang)](https://mkvl.me/tags/golang/), Command-Line Interface (CLI) Applications, TUIs, [Linux](https://mkvl.me/tags/linux/), [Git](https://mkvl.me/tags/git/), [Docker](https://mkvl.me/tags/docker), [Vim (Neovim)](https://mkvl.me/tags/vim), Kubernetes (k8s), [TDD](https://mkvl.me/tags/testing), [note-taking](https://mkvl.me/tags/zettelkasten) and other great stuff.

I find the way of learn in public is quite useful so here is my [Digital Garden](https://mkvl.me/notes).

If you wanna just chat with me - feel free to email me at [max@mkvl.me](mailto:max@mkvl.me).
