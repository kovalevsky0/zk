# About me

### Max Kovalevskii, a software developer

![photo](/images/avatar.jpg)

This is my website - the place where I share information and knowledge about topics that interest me with everyone and myself.

I have been working as a developer for several years. Most of the projects are related to web technologies, including UI (front end) side and server side.

I work on the project that build on these following stack: [TypeScript](TypeScript.md), [React](React.md), [Node](Node.md), [JestJS](JestJS.md), [RxJS](RxJS.md) and other great technologies.

I'm fun of static type checkers and languages, especially [TypeScript](TypeScript.md). Also, I'm interesting in writing tests, using code generators and some cool command-line tools.

Besides programming stuff, I like writing itself, reading weird articles, mechanical keyboards, keeping all information that I used somehow in life and taking notes - I do note-taking using [Zettelkasten method](Zettelkasten%20method.md).

I find the way of learn in public is quite useful so here is my [Digital Garden](https://mkvl.me/notes).

If you wanna just chat with me - feel free to email me at [me@mkvl.me](mailto:me@mkvl.me).
