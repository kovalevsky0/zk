# npx

**npx** is a package runner of [npm](npm.md) packages. It comes with [npm](npm.md) by default.

It is used for installing [npm](npm.md) package. There are some differences between **npx** and **npm install**:

* downloads the latest version of **X** package every time
* It is not dependent on when your **X** package is installed
  * Also it doesn't install package on your machine
