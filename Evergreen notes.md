# Evergreen notes

* Evergreen notes is a term that was invented by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)
* Evergreen notes are notes that have **actual** information. 
* They have been built not for short-term using. These notes can and should be used in **long-term**.
* Here is how I understand it:
  * They are called *evergreen* because they are like leaves that get watered. 
  * The more you put new or update current information in there than more they are *green*.
* Criteria:
  * Clear, understandable, compact (not short and not long) title of the note
  * Note should consist of your words. You have to write the note by *your hands, thoughts and words*.
  * You should linked the note with other note/s
  * Note should be dynamic, not static. The note "lives" and saturates the information.
