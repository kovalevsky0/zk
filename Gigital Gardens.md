# Digital Gardens

It is the way of sharing knowledge in the Web.

As far as I understand this terminology correctly, it is just another way of writing things like Zettelkasten method but more about "my own wiki". Sharing knowledge, learning in public, etc.

I've googled this term and wanna explore results.
